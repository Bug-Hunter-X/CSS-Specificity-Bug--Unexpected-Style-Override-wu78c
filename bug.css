The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the specificity of selectors leads to unexpected behavior.  The `#id1 .class1` selector, despite its high specificity, is overridden by the `div .class1` selector due to the cascading nature of CSS and the order in which they appear in the stylesheet. This can lead to difficult-to-debug issues where styles aren't applied as expected. 

```css
div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div .class1 {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This selector is more specific than #id1 .class1 and will override it. */
}

#id1 {
  background-color: yellow;
}

#id1 .class1 {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This is overridden by the div .class1 selector*/
}
```
