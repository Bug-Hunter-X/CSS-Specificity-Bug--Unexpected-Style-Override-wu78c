# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Style Override

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in CSS related to selector specificity and the order of stylesheets. The bug arises from the unexpected overriding of styles due to the cascading nature of CSS and the specificity of selectors.  The `div .class1` selector, despite being less specific in general than `#id1 .class1`, overrides the styling due to its position later in the stylesheet. 

## Bug Description
The primary issue is that selectors with higher specificity can be unintentionally overridden by less specific selectors that are defined later in the stylesheet. This leads to unexpected visual results and makes debugging more challenging. The provided `bug.css` file showcases this problem. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file presents a solution by prioritizing the more specific selector or using the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged). A better solution is to reorganize the CSS or use more specific selectors to avoid the conflict.
